    <p>One of the most obviously unique aspects is the "Appliance-Punk" aesthetic. In a future where computing techology is expensive to attach and standard human bodies are too expensive to maintain, what we view as home appliances have become body parts. Get ready to see both people like M. Wave and Thym who have technological components as well as beings more mechanical than human like the Big Iron. But because most of the game is closer to present day there will be plenty of non-modified people like Coalton who you'll get to meet in the demo.</p>
