This site is meant to be a base website to give both the info about the Chronowave: Global Appliance game Khai and I worked on for our capston project (which we hope to continue working on), it could also serve to be a website to hold pages for any other games we work on. While neither of us are specifically aiming to work in game design, it would be proof that we could in case we ever want to try to break into that field.
