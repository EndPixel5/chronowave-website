		<h2>About the Creators</h2>
            <h3>James Rabuzzi</h3>
		      James coded everything found in the platformer segments in Chronowave. The camera in the top-down sections also used the same camera code. Other things he contributed were making the menus work, moving the game to different screens, as well as adding all of the sounds found in the game.
		    <h3>Khailil Tookas</h3>
              Khai made all of the sprites and art in  and for the game, including the logo, poster, and background in this website. Other than that he coded the top-down sections' interaction and inventory systems.

    <h2>Important Mention: Sean Whitney</h2>
    <p>Sean made all of the music found in the game. James, Khai, and Sean have been trying to make games together for years. And since Sean is a musician he has been making chiptunes that could be usable for games made by James and Khai even while there wasn't much active game design happening.</p>

        <h2>Early History of the Game</h2>
        
        In 2022 James, Khai, Samuel Wang, and Ryan Recker joined in the Games 4 Health game jam which had the theme of "Revision." This led to the idea of time travel, and thinking about what would be something to use travel to revise, the idea of of eco-terrorism came about. Then to lighten the mood of the game a bit the "appliance-punk" art style was picked. After the game jam, James and Khai decided to continue working on the game for a college capstone project, with the permission of Ryan and Sam, by restarting development in the Unity engine instead of Pygame.
