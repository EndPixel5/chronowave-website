        <h4>Sean Whitney</h4>
        That man made the music. James, Khai, and Sean have been trying to make games together for years. And since Sean is a musician he has been making chiptunes that could be usable for games made by James and Khai even while there wasn't much active game design happening.
        <h4>Ryan Recker and Samuel Wang</h4>
        They also worked on the original game jam version of Chronowave.
        <h4>Benjamin Douglas</h4>
        Helped come up with the very initial idea of "time traveling eco-terrorism."
        <h2>Early History of the Game</h2>
        In 2022 James, Khai, Sam, and Ryan worked in the Games 4 Health game jam which had the theme of "Revision." This led to the idea of time travel, and thinking about what would be something to use travel to revise, the idea of of eco-terrorism came about. Then to lighten the mood of the game a bit the "appliance-punk" art style was picked. After the game jam, James and Khai decided to continue working on the game for a college capstone project, with the permission of Ryan and Sam, by restarting development in the Unity engine instead of Pygame.
